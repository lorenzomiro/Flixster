### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge that I had while building was making sure that the app was connected to the internet so that the YouTube API could run on my app. I had struggled on this for about 30 minutes until I went over to the Slack CodePath server to see that other students were having the same issue.

### User Stories
#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS

   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One of the biggest challenges I had was making sure that the screen would rotate and getting the movie data to load onto my app properly. Luckily this time, I had leveraged the resources offered by CodePath to solve the problems that I had for this project and got them unsolved after 30 minutes of struggling through the problems by myself unlike the prework where I spent longer to fix my bugs.
